## General info
The housing market looks already recovered from last economic crisis. I'm doing the analysis to answer my questions 
as following: 
* Chicago Housing is growing up from 2012 - current?
* The rise of house price in Chicago has slowed down?
* Mortgage rate has negative relationship with the numbers of home sold. 
* Which area is the most expensive in Chicago?
* How much did price increase/decrease over the years?
* Is there a particular month where houses are sold more?

## Data Source
 * Housing Data provided by Redfin https://www.redfin.com/blog/data-center/, a national real estate brokerage.
 * 30-year fixed mortgage data provided by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US

## Conclusions 
* Overall, the Chicago housing market is still growing but has slowed down from 2012 to current (2019). The median sale 
price PSF is continually increasing but the percentage of increase each year has decreased. Also, the 
average monthly unit sold has decreased since 2017. 

* According to the mortgage vs. house price graph, there is no direct relationship between 30-year fixed mortgage rate
and chicago house price.

* From the graph "Median Sale Price Psf in Chicago (by side)", the top three expensive sides in descending order:
    * Central Chicago
    * North Side
    * West Side

* From the graph "The most expensive communities in Chicago", the top 8 expensive communities in descending order:
    * Near North Side
    * Lincoln Park
    * The Loop
    * Near South Side
    * North Center
    * Lake View
    * Logan Square
    * Avondale
Within the 8 communities, the prices of Logan Square and Avondale have the most increase. It matches with the Chicago 
area development plan. The city has been expanding to both communities after last economy crisis. 

* Percentage change from 2012 - 2019:
    * 2013: There was a 15.22% median sale price per square feet increase in 2013 compared to 2012.
    * 2014: There was a 12.55% median sale price per square feet increase in 2014 compared to 2013.
    * 2015: There was a 5.06% median sale price per square feet increase in 2015 compared to 2014.
    * 2016: There was a 6.78% median sale price per square feet increase in 2016 compared to 2015.
    * 2017: There was a 4.44% median sale price per square feet increase in 2017 compared to 2016.
    * 2018: There was a 3.19% median sale price per square feet increase in 2018 compared to 2017.
    * 2019: There was a 2.32% median sale price per square feet increase in 2019 compared to 2018.
